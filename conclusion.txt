# Key Observations:

- Imbalanced Classes: even after applying smote to handle imbalance data,
- The dataset is highly imbalanced with majority class (0) having 1980 samples and minority class (1) having only 66 samples.
- Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model is 96.1%, which is relatively high but can be misleading due to the class imbalance.

# Precision and Recall:

- Precision (for class 0): Precision is 0.97, meaning when the model predicts non-bankrupt (0), it is correct 97% of the            time.
- Precision (for class 1): Precision is 0.05, meaning when the model predicts bankrupt (1), it is correct inly 5% of the            time.
- Recall (for class 0): Recall is 0.99, indicating that the model correctly identifies 99% of the non-bankrupt companies.
- Recall (for class 1): Recall is 0.02, indicating that the model correctly identifies 2% of the bankrupt companies.
- F1-score (for class 0): F1-score is 0.98, which balances precision and recall, providing a harmonic mean between them.
- F1-score (for class 1): F1-score is 0.02, which balances precision and recall, providing a harmonic mean between them.


# KEY INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Debt Ratio % and Bankruptcy:
   - Debt Ratio % shows the highest positive correlation with bankruptcy. This implies that as the Debt Ratio % increases, the         likelihood of bankruptcy also increases. 
   - Actionable Insight: Monitoring and managing the Debt Ratio % closely is crucial. Implementing stricter debt management            policies and ensuring that debt levels remain sustainable relative to assets and income is recommended.

2. Net Income to Total Assets and Bankruptcy:
   - Net Income to Total Assets exhibits the highest negative correlation with bankruptcy. Lower values of Net Income to Total         Assets indicate higher chances of bankruptcy.
   - Actionable Insight: Focus on improving profitability relative to total assets. Strategies may include cost management,            revenue enhancement, and efficient asset utilization.

3. ROA(A) and ROA(B) before Interest and Taxes:
   - Both ROA(A) and ROA(B) before interest and taxes show negative correlations with bankruptcy, indicating that lower                profitability ratios are associated with higher bankruptcy risks.
   - Actionable Insight: Enhance operational efficiency and profitability metrics. This could involve optimizing resource              allocation, improving operational processes, and diversifying revenue streams.

4. Current Liability to Assets:
   - Higher values of Current Liability to Assets are associated with increased bankruptcy risk. This ratio reflects short-term o      obligations relative to total assets.
   - Actionable Insight: Manage short-term liabilities effectively. Strategies may include negotiating favorable terms with            creditors, optimizing working capital management, and ensuring adequate cash flow for debt servicing.

# Recommendations for Financial Risk Management:

1. Strengthen Financial Health Monitoring:
   - Implement regular monitoring of financial health indicators such as Debt Ratio %, Net Income to Total Assets, and ROA. Set        threshold values for these metrics and trigger alerts for early intervention if thresholds are exceeded.

2. Risk Mitigation Strategies:
   - Develop and implement robust risk mitigation strategies tailored to identified risk factors. For instance, establish              contingency plans for managing debt levels during economic downturns or adverse market conditions.

3. Enhance Financial Modeling and Forecasting:
   - Utilize advanced financial modeling techniques to forecast key financial ratios and their impact on bankruptcy risk.            - Incorporate scenario analysis to assess the resilience of the business under various economic scenarios.

4. Diversification and Revenue Management:
   - Explore diversification strategies to reduce dependency on specific revenue sources or markets. Diversification can mitigate      risks associated with fluctuations in market conditions or industry-specific challenges.

5. Continuous Improvement and Adaptation:
   - Foster a culture of continuous improvement in financial management practices. Regularly review and adapt strategies based on      evolving market dynamics, regulatory changes, and internal performance insights.
